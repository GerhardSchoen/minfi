# Introduction

The `r Biocpkg("minfi")` package provides tools for analyzing Illumina's Methylation arrays, with a
special focus on the new 450k array for humans.  At the moment Illumina's 27k methylation arrays are
partially supported; some of the functionality may not work (or may not make sense) for the older
27k array, other functionality works fine.

The tasks addressed in this package include preprocessing, QC assessments, identification of
interesting methylation loci and plotting functionality.  Analyzing these types of arrays is ongoing
research in ours and others groups.  In general, the analysis of 450k data is not straightforward
and we anticipate many advances in this area in the near future.

The input data to this package are IDAT files, representing two different color channels prior to
normalization.  It is possible to use Genome Studio files together with the data structures
contained in this package, but in general Genome Studio files are already normalized and we do not
recommend this.

## Citing the minfi package

If you are using minfi in a publication, please cite [@minfi].

The SWAN normalization method
is described in [@Maksimovic:2012].  The functional normalization method is described in [@funnorm].  The code for parsing Illumina IDAT files is from the `r Biocpkg("illuminaio")` package
described in [@illuminaio].
